Basic Game Guide
You control the sub like object. 
Arrow keys to move around.
Press space bar to fire a bullet.

Your goal is to kill as many fish without dying.

If you run into a fish you will kill the fish but also take damage.

Air bubbles appear to increase your health if you run into them.

Enemies come in waves of four with more waves in increasing levels.
At the end of level you can either upgrade your rate of fire or bullet power.

Week 1 Ideas
- objects (see all player.js, enemy.js etc)
- closures (see enemy.js for position functions)
- scope (globals declared at top of main.js vs all others in funcitons)
- Arrays (enemies, bullet, etc are stored in arrays and forEach loops to modify)
- Events (use keydown and keyup events)
- Timers
- Images & sprites (all displayed characters)
- Drawing (all interface are with text and shape drawing)
